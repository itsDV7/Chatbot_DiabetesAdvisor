       Hola!
       This is your *Diabetes Bot*, here to help you. :')

       Diabetes is a manageable condition, but if left untreated it can cause serious harm.

       Here's how I can help you.
       Select one of these options: 
       * Diagnosis
       * Recommendation
       * Reminder
  utter_feature_recommendation:

      I can give recommendations to help you manage your Diabetes and suggest some lifestyle changes.
      Before that, I need you to answer some simple questions.

      One last question,
       What's your Diabetes Type? (Type1|Type2):
       - Type 1: Your body does not produce Insulin at all
       - Type 2: Your body does not respond to Insulin as it should

      Exercise is an important part of treating type 1. 
      But it isn’t as simple as going for a run. Exercise affects your blood sugar levels.
      So you have to balance your insulin dose and the food you eat with any activity, even simple tasks around the house or yard.
      Knowledge is power. Check your blood sugar before, during, and after an activity to find out how it affects you.
      Some things will make your levels go up; others won't. You can lower your insulin or have a snack with carbs to keep it from dropping too low.
      If your blood sugar is high -- above 240 mg/dL -- test for ketones, the acids that can result from high sugar levels.
      If they’re OK, you should be good to go. If they’re high, skip the workout. You’ll also need to understand how food affects your blood sugar.
      Once you know the roles that carbs, fats, and protein play, you can build a healthy eating plan that helps keep your levels where they should be.
      A diabetes educator or registered dietitian can help you get started.

      Balancing your meals can improve your bodily health and delay the onset of diabetes symptoms.
      Try to get an even mixture of:
      - starches
      - fruits and vegetables
      - fats
      - proteins
      You should avoid excess sugar, especially in carbonated drinks such as soda and in candies.
      Keep a regular exercise schedule and manage your blood sugar within your exercise regimen.
      This can allow you to get the full benefits of a workout without feeling shaky, tired, dizzy, or anxious.
